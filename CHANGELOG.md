# Change Log

The following enhancements and changes have been made to Atari Dev Studio:

## 0.11.7

 * Added stowatch timer for batari Basic and 7800basic build compilation

## 0.11.6

 * Restored batari Basic debugger extensions to previous (.lst, .sym)
 * Fixed issue where sometimes compilation issues didn't always cleanup files (batari Basic and 7800basic)

## 0.11.5

 * Fix for spaces in paths and filenames in batari Basic compilation (Linux/MacOS)
 * Internal code re-organisation and optimisations
 
## 0.11.4

 * Updated Learning Center so when you open a sample it's **core** document is also opened
 * Added a compiler warning to validate if your project folder or file contains spaces (can be turned off in the **Settings**)
 * Re-organised and updated compiler messages order
 * Fixed issue with moving debugger files depending on the chosen batari Basic compiler (filenames have changed)
 * Internal code re-organisation and optimisations

## 0.11.3

 * Added Learning Center (currenty 7800basic).

## 0.11.2

 * Added Operating System, VSCode and ADS version information to output log
 * Cleanup areas of the compilation process including message wording and version validations
 * Update Custom Folder transposition to also check for an existing folder entry (incase of profile syncing)
 * Updated minimum VSCode requirements to v1.103.2 and removed old system dependency packages not required
 * Fixed opening browsers on some systems

## 0.11.1

* Updated batari Basic to v0.19 (wasm).  NOTE: this is now a cross-platform release that requires the **wasmtime** runtime to be installed on your computer.
* Added the following ADS definition tags:
   - ;#ADSLanguage=**language** and ;#ADSCompiler=**compiler**

   These will define the default language and compiler for your source files directly in your code. Definition tags are **IntelliSense-aware**, so you will receive auto-completion and suggestions as you type.
* Added new **Custom Folders** lists to allow users to define multiple compilers for each language.
* Added transfer of old batari Basic & 7800basic **Custom Folder** settings into the new **Custom Folders** list for each language (if any exist)
* Added batari Basic code completion options
* Fixed #ifconst, #else, #endif compiler directives in 7800basic
* Updated 7800basic keyword lists

## 0.11.0

* Updated 7800basic to v0.38 (wasm).

## 0.10.9

* Updated 7800basic to v0.37 (wasm).  NOTE: this is now a cross-platform release that requires the **wasmtime** runtime to be installed on your computer.
* Updated the Output compiler window title to `Atari Compiler` for better identification (fredsa)
* Updated the Atari Dev Studio startup process with the following chages: 
  - output to the `Atari Compiler` log and advise the status of the extension (version, location, wasmtime)
  - validate and install (as required) the **wasmtime** runtime automatically.
* Updated the compiler output to be properly formatted across multiple batches (it previously included line feeds when not required)
* Updated the Sprite Editor with the following changes:
  - Fixed an issue when editing 2600 sprites holding the shift key would clear the entire row not just the chosen cell (cheesywhiz)
* Updated 7800basic keyword lists
* Started updating the 7800basic hover tooltips to new format with included links to on-line help (TBC)
* Added information outlining the usage and potential compilation of out of date compilers used of Atari Dev Studio for MacOS arm64 machines (fredsa)

## 0.10.5

* Update Stella to the latest version (v7.0).  

Note: Stella emulation in Atari Dev Studio is now fully 64-bit only.  If you wish to use an older 32-bit version, configure a custom path in the Settings instead (Emulator â€º Stella: Path).

## 0.10.4

* Updated the Sprite Editor with the following changes:
  - Rebuilt the 2600 and 7800 Export window to offer a more streamlined and feature rich process
  - Updated the Editor and Palette features to work with multi-color 2600 sprites

* Updated the Sprite Editor with the following changes:
  - Added line, rectangle, ellipse, color picker tools
  - Updated the undo/redo storage to better handle various tool usage - some tools either didn't work as expected or over saved changes

## 0.10.1

* Updated compile routine to ensure the 'code' document area is selected before determining the required document to compile (fix for when the console area active and not the code document area and not compiling)
* Fixed an issue with the 7800basic.sh (and updated 2600basic.sh also) containing a CRLF ending causing the compiler to not process (thanks Mats).

## 0.10.0

* Added status bar and command palette links to PlayerPal 2600 and Atari Background Builder (thanks kisrael) websites (opens in the system default browser currently)
* Removed existing Sprite Editor due to lack for proper features to edit 2600 objects as well as other missing functionality.  Also the code libraries are dangerously out of date according to Github and not updatable in some cases without serious effort.  Recommend using Paint.Net (Windows) or Gimp for now - any other suggestions welcome.

Note: you can still open a Makefile and compile from that if required.

## 0.3.9

* Added ability to use 'Make' to compile your source code (Andrew Davie). Note: this feature is experimental and requires the user to have a fully configured environment to compile and launch emulation outside VS Code (tested only on macOS)

## 0.1.4, 0.1.5

The Sprite Editor is based on Spritemate by Ingo Hinterding ([github](https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate)) and was suggested by RandomTerrain. I've taken the original source and rebuilt and restructured it. It cannot do anything other than the basics - just wanted to see if it ran OK on other PCs.
